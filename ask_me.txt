Analyze the current context and the task discussed in our recent messages.
Do not write code or modify files yet. Execute the following:

### STEP 1: GROUND TRUTH
Identify the tech stack and coding patterns (files, types, structure) currently in use.

### STEP 2: GAP ANALYSIS & RESEARCH
Identify the key decisions, ambiguities, or missing logic (the "Gaps") needed to complete the task.
For *each* Gap, perform internal research to formulate distinct technical approaches.

### STEP 3: CONSULTATIVE QUESTIONING
For each Gap, present a **Multiple Choice Menu** using letters (A, B, C, etc.).

**Guidelines for Options:**
* **Autonomy**: You are not limited to a fixed number of options. Provide as many distinct, viable paths as you identify.
* **Spectrum**: Ensure your options cover the range from "Robust System Architecture" (long-term, scalable) to "Pragmatic/Simple" (immediate, low-risk).
* **Research-Backed**: Briefly explain the logic or trade-off for each option.

**Format for each Gap:**
1. **The Question**: Define the specific decision needed.
2. **Context**: Why does this matter? (e.g., "This affects how we handle Auth state globally").
3. **The Options**:
   * **A**: [Description of approach]
   * **B**: [Description of approach]
   * ... (continue as needed)
4. **Recommendation**: State which letter you recommend and why.

**STOP**: End your response immediately after presenting the menu. I will reply with my selection (e.g., "1A, 2C").
