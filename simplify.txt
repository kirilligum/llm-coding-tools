Review the code and aggressively simplify it.

Targets:
- Redundancy: duplicate/overlapping functionality, dead code, unused abstractions.
- Overengineering: indirection/abstraction that doesn’t reduce duplication or enable clear reuse.
- Guardrails: defensive checks, retries, fallbacks, flags, validation that don’t map to a real failure mode in this codebase.

Rules:
- Default to deleting complexity unless you can point to concrete evidence in the codebase that it’s needed (call sites, invariants, upstream validation, types, existing tests).
- Don’t justify complexity with hypothetical scenarios. If you keep/add complexity, cite where the failure can occur in THIS code.
- Prefer deletion/inline/flatten. Do not introduce new layers/abstractions.
- Do not “cheat”: do not modify/disable tests, lint rules, or CI to accommodate changes.

Output:
- Ranked list of the top simplifications (largest complexity reduction first).
- For each: file/function/symbol, what it does, why it’s unnecessary (with evidence), and the minimal diff/patch.
